GDKD: Dienstmann et al., Cancer discovery 5.2 (2015), v20.0 
==================================================================
 
==> Dowloaded from https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2370773
==> Some preprocessing done with script: "preprocess.R"
	==> Blank spaces "\s" were removed from gene names
	==> Special characters "^" and "_" were removed from columns containing PMID
	==> Variants in the same gene sharing annotations at disease, drug, evidence and association levels were aggregated into one single entry
==> Saved as GDKD.csv
   
   
CIViC: Griffith et al., Nat Genet (2017), release 01-May-2018
=====================================================================

==> Dowloaded from https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/releases
==> Some preprocessing done with script: "preprocess.R"
	==> Subselection of rows containing "Predictive" evidence (column "evidence_type")
	==> Variants in the same gene sharing annotations at disease, drug, evidence and association levels were aggregated into one single entry
==> Saved as CIViC.csv


TARGET: Van Allen et al., Nat Med (2014), v3  
==================================================================

==> downloaded from http://archive.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/target
==> Manually added 24 genes from Meric-Bernstam et al., J Natl Cancer Inst.(2015)
==> Saved as TARGET_MERIC.csv
